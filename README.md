# portfolio-optimisation

Objective: Construct a portfolio consisting of 43 industry portfolios (risky assets), with the goal of maximising Sharpe ratio when evaluated on the test dataset. 

The results of the usage of a robust shrinkage estimator for returns and the covariance matrix gave results that exceeded that of the Tangency Portfolio and also CVaR portfolio. 
The dataset was extracted from the Kenneth R. French data library, with a time period of 1986-2015
